# Initial-Coin-Offering-Contract-in-Solidity
In this repo, I built a simple ICO contract that manages every vital aspect of coin ordering, processing, and delivery.

I commented well on the code for faster understaning of the logic.

In the future, I will keep adding more functioanlities that will make this contract more robust, battle-tested, and complex.

PS: I learned this from Abhishek Chauhan's repo
